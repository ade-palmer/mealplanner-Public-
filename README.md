# Meal Planner (Public)

This app has been written in .Net Core 3 MVC. I managed to play with Bootstrap SCSS Compilers alongside many .Net Core features.

**Demo:** http://mealplanner365.com/MealPlan/0c1574aa-a75a-4b57-bbfa-e63cac9c4a96

## TODO
Sensitive data in the appsettings.json. Although non-functioning values have been used for publication, I need a more secure solution.
- Azure KeyVault
- GitIgnore
- etc.

Remove unnecessary comments that have been left in to help me review.
